I could have made money this way, and perhaps amused myself writing code. But I knew that at the end of my career, I would look back on years of building walls to divide people, and feel I had spent my life making the world a worse place.

When I do this, some people think that it's because I want my ego to be fed, right? Of course, I'm not asking you to call it "Stallmanix"!
%
I'm always happy when I'm protesting.

Geeks like to think that they can ignore politics, you can leave
politics alone, but politics won't leave you alone.
%
People sometimes ask me if it is a sin in the Church of Emacs to use vi. Using a free version of vi is not a sin; it is a penance. So happy hacking.

If programmers deserve to be rewarded for creating innovative programs, by the same token they deserve to be punished if they restrict the use of these programs.
%
Fighting patents one by one will never eliminate the danger of software patents, any more than swatting mosquitoes will eliminate malaria.
%
People said I should accept the world. Bullshit! I don't accept the world.
%
Giving the Linus Torvalds Award to the Free Software Foundation is a bit like giving the Han Solo Award to the Rebel Alliance.

Would a dating service on the net be ‘frowned upon’ . . . ? I hope not. But even if it is, don’t let that stop you from notifying me via net mail if you start one.
%
Once GNU is written, everyone will be able to obtain good system software free, just like air.
%
If you want to accomplish something in the world, idealism is not enough--you need to choose a method that works to achieve the goal. In other words, you need to be "pragmatic.
%
No person, no idea, and no religion deserves to be illegal to insult, not even the Church of Emacs.
%
Today many people are switching to free software for purely practical reasons. That is good, as far as it goes, but that isn't all we need to do! Attracting users to free software is not the whole job, just the first step.
%
If in my lifetime the problem of non-free software is solved, I could
perhaps relax and write software again. But I might instead try to
help deal with the world's larger problems. Standing up to an evil
system is exhilarating, and now have a taste for it.
%
I see nothing unethical in the job it does. Why shouldn't you send a copy of some music to a friend?
%
'Free software' is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of 'free' as in 'free speech,' not as in 'free beer'.
%
For personal reasons, I do not browse the web from my computer. (I also have no net connection much of the time.) To look at page I send mail to a daemon which runs wget and mails the page back to me. It is very efficient use of my time, but it is slow in real time.

Playfully doing something difficult, whether useful or not, that is hacking.
%
Copying all or parts of a program is as natural to a programmer as
breathing, and as productive. It ought to be as free.
%
Sharing is good, and with digital technology, sharing is easy.

If you want to accomplish something in the world, idealism is not
enough - you need to choose a method that works to achieve the goal.
%
Proprietary software tends to have malicious features. The point is
with a proprietary program, when the users don't have the source code,
we can never tell. So you must consider every proprietary program as
potential malware.
%
Facebook is not your friend, it is a surveillance engine.

I suppose many people will continue moving towards careless
computing, because there's a sucker born every minute.
%
Free software is software that respects your freedom and the social
solidarity of your community. So it's free as in freedom.
%
Android is very different from the GNU/Linux operating system because
it contains very little of GNU. Indeed, just about the only component
in common between Android and GNU/Linux is Linux, the kernel.
%
With paper printed books, you have certain freedoms. You can acquire the book anonymously by paying cash, which is the way I always buy books. I never use a credit card. I don't identify to any database when I buy books. Amazon takes away that freedom.
%
CD stores have the disadvantage of an expensive inventory, but
digital bookshops would need no such thing: they could write copies at
the time of sale on to memory sticks, and sell you one if you forgot
your own.
%
The computer industry is the only industry that is more
fashion-driven than women's fashion.
%
In essence, Chrome OS is the GNU/Linux operating system. However, it
is delivered without the usual applications, and rigged up to impede
and discourage installing applications.
%
The idea of copyright did not exist in ancient times, when authors
frequently copied other authors at length in works of
non-fiction. This practice was useful, and is the only way many
authors' works have survived even in part.

Anything that prevents you from being friendly, a good neighbour, is

All governments should be pressured to correct their abuses of human

Whether gods exist or not, there is no way to get absolute certainty

If you use a proprietary program or somebody else's web server,
you're defenceless. You're putty in the hands of whoever developed
that software.

Android is a major step towards an ethical, user-controlled,
free-software portable phone, but there is a long way to go.
%
Officially, MPAA stands for Motion Picture Association of America,
but I suggest that MPAA stands for Malicious Power Attacking All.
%
Also, because schools must teach the spirit of goodwill, the habit of
helping others around you, every class should have this rule:
students, if you bring software to class you may not keep it for
yourself.
%
The paradigm of competition is a race: by rewarding the winner, we
encourage everyone to run faster. When capitalism really works this
way, it does a good job; but its defenders are wrong in assuming it
always works this way.
%
The reason that a good citizen does not use such destructive means to
become wealthier is that, if everyone did so, we would all become
poorer from the mutual destructiveness.
%
When I launched the development of the GNU system, I explicitly said
the purpose of developing this system is so we can use our computers
and have freedom, thus if you use some other free system instead but
you have freedom, then it's a success. It's not popularity for our
code but it's success for our goal."
%
The desire to be rewarded for one's creativity does not justify
depriving the world in general of all or part of that creativity.
%
In the free/libre software movement, we develop software that
respects users' freedom, so we and you can escape from software that
doesn't.

If programmers deserve to be rewarded for creating innovative

Control over the use of one's ideas really constitutes control over
other people's lives; and it is usually used to make their lives more
difficult.

Proprietary software is an injustice.

There is nothing wrong with wanting pay for work, or seeking to
maximize one's income, as long as one does not use means that are
destructive.
%
If ebooks mean that readers' freedom must either increase or
decrease, we must demand the increase.
%
Software patents are dangerous to software developers because they
impose monopolies on software ideas.
%
In practice, the copyright system does a bad job of supporting
authors, aside from the most popular ones. Other authors' principal
interest is to be better known, so sharing their work benefits them as
well as readers.
%
In the US, you even lose legal rights if you store your data in a
company's machines instead of your own. The police need to present you
with a search warrant to get your data from you; but if they are
stored in a company's server, th police can get it without showing you
anything.
%
One reason you should not use web applications to do your computing
is that you lose control.
%
The interesting thing about cloud computing is that we've redefined
cloud computing to include everything that we already do.
%
Facebook collects a lot of data from people and admits it. And it
also collects data which isn't admitted. And Google does too. As for
Microsoft, I don't know. But I do know that Windows has features that
send data about the user.
%
If there is a Like button in a page, Facebook knows who visited that
page. And it can get IP address of the computer visiting the page even
if the person is not a Facebook user.

I do not eat breakfast. Please do not ask me any questions about what

One situation where I do not need help, let alone supervision, is in
crossing streets. I grew up in the middle of the world's biggest city,
full of cars, and I have crossed streets without assistance even in
the chaotic traffic of Bangalore and Delhi. Please just leave me alone
when I cross streets.
